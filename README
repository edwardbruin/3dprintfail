to use this code, you will need a few things
a link to a video stream (and presumably control over it)
a destination email address to send alerts
The code is currently seeks for these from a google bucket. modify to point to your endpoint (no, I don't know what a config file is)

You will also need:
a google account that can use an app password (if newly created accounts are not working, try a mature account)
our weights file for YOLOv8
